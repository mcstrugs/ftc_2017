## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains our code. It's really bad and I don't know how to code.
All jokes aside... we don't have a complete robot so we don't know if it is good or not.

* autonomous: written - no; tested on robot - no.
* drive: written - yes; tested on robot - no.
* lift: written - yes; tested on robot - no.
* claws: written - yes; tested on robot - no.
